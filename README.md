This is my first project experimenting with React.  My friend (Mr Levendis) enjoys hosting christmas caroling every year, but navigating his giant Google Doc full of the song lyrics could be challenging.  I created this web application that will display all of the song lyrics as well as a table of contents and the ability to automatically jump to a desired page by number.

Currently the code is in desparate need of refactoring (I learned a lot about React in the process of making this by making plenty of mistakes!).  I also want to add the ability to filter the table of contents, search by title or lyrics, and make the UI a little more intuitive.  Hopefully these will be completed by Christmas 2022!
